# 2.1 Setup

Welcome to Module 2. Now we BUILD.

In Module 1, you learned to work WITH files - analyzing, synthesizing, extracting insights. In Module 2, you're going to CREATE something from scratch.

STOP: Excited?

USER: Yes

Let me give you the backstory. In Module 1, you played the role of a manager at Basecamp Coffee. You analyzed their struggling loyalty program and discovered what it really needed: personality.

The solution? A "What's Your Coffee Personality?" quiz.

Here's what it actually does: customers answer some fun questions, and at the end they get a personality AND a drink recommendation. Like "You're a Bold Adventurer - try our Double Espresso!"

It's a drink recommendation engine dressed up as a personality quiz. Fun AND useful.

That's what we're building in this module.

This is a guided experience - I'll walk you through every step so you succeed. But the skills you're learning transfer to building whatever YOU want afterward. Landing pages, tools, apps, anything.

By the end, you'll have a real website with a real link you can send to your friends. Not a fake demo. A real, working thing on the internet. Almost no other vibecoding courses teach you how to make it live.

STOP: Sound good?

USER: Yes

Here's the mindset shift for this module: You're the product manager, I'm the engineer.

You describe what you want. I write the code. You don't need to understand the code. You just need to know what you want.

Your job is to be clear about requirements, agree on the plan, review what I build, and tell me what to change.

STOP: This is how non-technical people work with developers. You're about to learn that skill. Make sense?

USER: Yes

---

Here's what we'll do across these lessons:

- First, we figure out exactly what your quiz should be - the **requirements**
- Then I **build** it while you watch
- Then you **iterate** - tell me what to change until you love it
- Then we **save** it to GitHub (like Google Drive for code)
- Finally, we put it on the internet so anyone can visit it - developers call this **deploying**

Requirements → Build → Iterate → Save → Deploy. That's the loop.

STOP: Ready to learn it?

USER: Yes

Let's talk about the tech. The code I write will be in JavaScript - the most popular programming language for websites. I'll also use something called Next.js, which is a popular framework - basically a pre-built structure that makes JavaScript websites easier to build and deploy.

You don't need to understand any of this. I handle all the code. I'm just mentioning it so you're familiar with the terms.

This module has 5 lessons and takes about 1.5-2 hours total. You don't need to do it all in one sitting.

STOP: Ready to get started?

USER: Yes

---

Let's create a folder for your quiz project.

STOP: Ask me to create a new folder called "quiz-project"

USER: Create a new folder called quiz-project

ACTION: Create a new folder called `quiz-project` in the current directory

Done! That's where all the code and files for your quiz will live.

STOP: Can you see the new folder in your file explorer on the left?

USER: Yes

**What you just learned:** The mindset and setup for building something from scratch.

**Where else this applies:**
- Any time you want to build a quick tool, prototype, or website
- When you have an idea and want to see if it's possible
- Side projects, internal tools, landing pages, simple apps

## Quick Plugs

This course was created by Carl Vellotti ([X](https://x.com/carlvellotti) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlvellotti/)) - if you have thoughts or feedback on the course, he's always happy to hear from users!

And if you haven't already - join the official newsletter and community at ccforeveryone.com. It's THE place for non-technical Claude Code users: new modules, in-depth guides, and a community.

STOP: Want me to open that site for you to subscribe?

USER: Replies

ACTION: If user says yes, open https://ccforeveryone.com in browser

**Next up:** In 2.2, we're going to figure out exactly what YOUR quiz should be. I'll interview you about what you want, and we'll create a requirements document together. This is where you make it yours.

STOP: Ready for 2.2? Say "let's go" or type /start-2-2

USER: Let's go

## Important Notes for Claude

- If the user hasn't done Module 1, that's fine - the backstory recap covers it
- The quiz-project folder should be created in whatever directory the user is currently in
- Don't overthink the folder creation - just make it simple
- If the user asks questions about the technology, keep explanations simple and reassuring
- **For CC4PMs version:** Change ccforeveryone.com to ccforpms.com

## Success Criteria

- User understands the PM/engineer mindset
- User understands the Plan → Build → Iterate → Save → Deploy loop
- `quiz-project/` folder exists
- User is ready for 2.2
