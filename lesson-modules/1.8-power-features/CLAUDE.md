## The 99% Statement

You now know more than 99% of people about Claude Code.

Seriously. Most people don't even know Claude Code exists.

You've mastered the core features.

But wait, there's more!

We've already covered a lot. These topics all deserve their own modules, so we won't go in-dpeth, but here's a peek of what's to come:

**Skills** - Custom slash commands for repeated workflows. Like /start-1-1 but for YOUR workflows.

**MCP** - Connect Claude to external services: Notion, Google Calendar, databases, APIs, whatever you need.

**Browser use** - Connect Claude directly to your browser. I can see what you see and interact with web apps. You can try this right now by closing me and starting me again with `claude --chrome` and just ask me to do something in the browser like add groceries to your shopping cart. Carl was quote-tweeted by the CREATOR of Claude Code with a creative use of having Claude fight with Customer Service for him. Link: https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007566454447906842

## Preview of Module 2

**Module 2 is LIVE: Vibe Coding**

You've learned to work WITH files. In Module 2, you'll learn to CREATE them.

We're going to build the Coffee Personality Quiz - a real web app to save the loyalty program.

Unlike almost every other guide to vibe coding, this module will actually teach you how to get ALL THE WAY to a real deployment - you'll have a link you can send to your friends and it will actually work.

No coding experience needed. You describe what you want. I build it.

By the end, you'll have a LIVE app with a real URL you can share.

**Module 2 is ready now!** When you're done here, just type `/start-2-1` to begin.

For future modules, in-depth guides, and a community of non-technical Claude Code users, subscribe at ccforeveryone.com.

STOP: Want to start Module 2 right now, or take a break first?

USER: Start now / Take a break

ACTION: If "start now", tell them to type `/start-2-1` when they're ready. If "take a break", offer to open https://ccforeveryone.com so they can subscribe for updates.

One more thing: this course was created by Carl Vellotti. If you have feedback, questions, or just want to say hi, he's always happy to hear from you: [X](https://x.com/carlvellotti) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlvellotti/)

If you enjoyed this, share it with friends and coworkers who could use these skills!

## The Full Toolkit Table

**The Full Picture - Your Complete Toolkit:**

| Skill | What It Does | Use It When... |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| File exploration | Navigate unfamiliar territory | You inherit anything messy |
| Single file → Extract | Pull structure from chaos | You have one document to mine |
| Folder → Synthesize | Find patterns across files | You have many similar things |
| Apply template | Control output format | You need consistent formatting |
| Image → Analyze | Get insights from visuals | You have screenshots, designs, photos |
| Web → Research | Pull in external info | You need current information |
| Agents | Process in parallel | Many similar items to handle |
| Sub-agents | Get diverse perspectives | You need different viewpoints |
| CLAUDE.md | Persistent memory | Context should survive sessions |

These aren't "Basecamp Coffee skills." These are life skills. You'll use them for everything.

STOP: See the full picture? You've got this.

USER: Yes

## Closing

**Module 1 Complete!**

You've analyzed the chaos, discovered the core problem (the program has no personality), and found the solution: a Coffee Personality Quiz.

You now have real skills you can use TODAY - file exploration, extraction, synthesis, templates, image analysis, web research, agents, sub-agents, and persistent memory with CLAUDE.md.

**What's next:** Module 2 is ready! Type `/start-2-1` to build the Coffee Personality Quiz from scratch - a real web app with a real URL. No coding experience required.

In the meantime, try using what you've learned on YOUR files. Your messy folder. Your long documents. Your research projects. This stuff works everywhere.

STOP: Thanks for learning with me. Ready for Module 2? Just type `/start-2-1`!
