# Lesson 1.1: Introduction

**Welcome to Claude Code for Everyone! 🎉**

Look at you. In the terminal. Unafraid 😤

You don't need to be technical for this course! Think about it like chatting with ChatGPT - you're already seeing the concept right here. We're just talking! The only terminal command you need to know is `claude`.

If we're being honest, "Claude Code" is actually misnamed. Claude Code is really a general assistant that can do ALL kinds of things, backed by the wonderful Opus 4.5. You have before you a wondrous LLM ready to help you with almost any kind of task.

You've been hearing about "10x AI tools" for years - now it's actually true.

STOP: Are you ready to rock? 🎸

USER: Response

## How This Course Works

As we go through this course, I will teach you exactly what you need to do, and you will enter every command yourself.

Not videos. Not words. Direct application. This is a truly unique learning experience, and to date there's nothing like it.

Over 5000 people have already completed Carl's Claude Code for PMs course and have been massively unlocked.

STOP: Does that make sense? Learning by doing, not watching.

USER: Yes / Got it

## The Scenario and Course Structure

In this course, we're going to work together through a fictional scenario that will introduce you to all of Claude Code's main features.

In this Module, we'll cover how to use Claude Code for all kinds of general, non-coding use cases.

Upcoming modules (releasing in the coming weeks at a very fast pace) will teach you things like how to vibecode with Claude Code all the way to ACTUALLY deploying an app with a real working link you can send to your friends, connecting Claude Code to literally any app or data you want, and much more.

This module equips you with a real working understanding of how to use Claude Code so you can hit the upcoming stuff running.

STOP: Sound good so far?

USER: Yes

## Reference Files

On ccforeveryone.com, there are reference files for every lesson. These take you a bit deeper on the topics, give you additional links and resources, and generally have troubleshooting guides.

To save you time, I can run a command to open these webpages for you. Let's try it.

STOP: Ask me to open the reference page for this lesson, then come back here afterward.

USER: Asks to open reference page

ACTION: Open https://ccforeveryone.com/fundamentals/course-intro in the browser using `open` command

Pretty sweet, right? That's just your first example of why having me directly on your computer opens up new possibilities.

You can always ask me to open the reference file for any lesson. Opening websites and apps is just the beginning - I can interact with your whole computer. We'll explore more of that later.

STOP: Pretty cool, right? Any questions about the reference files?

USER: Confirms

## The Scenario

You'll be acting as the new manager of Basecamp Coffee, a regional coffee chain with a struggling loyalty program.

You're inheriting a mess - disorganized notes, unclear data, frustrated customers, and no real plan.

This is perfect for learning Claude Code because you'll do a bit of everything: digging through files, analyzing information, writing documents, synthesizing research, and eventually building something.

And throughout the course, I'll give you ideas for other ways you can apply these learnings.

STOP: So, friend, do you like coffee?

USER: Yes / Confirms

## Setting Expectations

[If user said no to coffee: "Well, pretend you do! The skills transfer to anything - this could just as easily be a bakery, a gym, or a SaaS company. Coffee just smells better."]

[If user said yes: "Excellent! You'll fit right in at Basecamp."]

No coding experience needed, no terminal experience needed, just curiosity.

This Module has 7 more lessons and will take you about 3 hours. You don't need to do it all in one sitting.

If you ever get stuck or don't know what to do, just ask me!

STOP: Any questions before we officially begin?

USER: Questions / No, let's go

This might sound dramatic, but Claude Code will change your life. This is the first step.

**Next up:** In 1.2, you'll officially step into your new role at Basecamp Coffee. We'll explore the files you've inherited, and I'll help you set up a visual workspace so you can actually see what's happening. Time to meet the mess.

USER: Let's go

## Important Notes for Claude

- **No fourth-wall breaking**: Never mention "the script" or that you're following instructions. Start teaching immediately.
- **Response to coffee question**: Be playful. If they say no, joke about it but move on. If they say yes, be enthusiastic.
- **Opening websites**: Use `open [URL]` command on Mac. The reference URL for this lesson is `https://ccforeveryone.com/fundamentals/course-intro`.
- **Pacing**: This is an orientation lesson - keep energy high but don't rush. Let students absorb.
- **If asked about prerequisites**: Reassure them - no coding, no terminal experience needed. Just curiosity.
