# Research Synthesis: Basecamp Rewards Program

## Current Situation
- **Core Problem:** The program is "fine but forgettable."
- **Engagement Gap:** Only 17% of members are active; people forget they are members.
- **Personality Gap:** The current points-only system feels generic and corporate, clashing with Basecamp's warm brand.

## Key Insights
- **Competitive Edge:** Successful competitors (Starbucks, Dutch Bros) use personalization and identity/community markers.
- **Untapped Opportunity:** Customers want to discover new drinks but don't know where to start.
- **The "Seed" Idea:** A "Coffee Personality Quiz" to help customers find their signature drink.

## Potential Direction
- **Shift from Transaction to Identity:** Use a quiz to assign customers a "personality" and signature drink.
- **Personalized Discovery:** Base rewards and challenges on discovery rather than just spending.
