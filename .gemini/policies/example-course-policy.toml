# 🛡️ Gemini CLI Policy Engine - Course Example
# =============================================
# This file shows how to control what Gemini CLI can do automatically.
# Think of these as "house rules" for your AI assistant.
#
# Policy files go in: ~/.gemini/policies/
# All .toml files in that folder are loaded automatically.
#
# Three possible decisions:
#   allow    = do it automatically, no need to ask
#   deny     = never do this, block it completely
#   ask_user = always ask me first (the default behavior)
#
# Higher priority number = this rule wins over lower ones.
# =============================================

# ✅ ALLOW: Safe read-only commands - no need to ask every time
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "git status"
decision = "allow"
priority = 100

[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "git log"
decision = "allow"
priority = 100

[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "ls"
decision = "allow"
priority = 100

# ✅ ALLOW: Opening files for reading is always safe
[[rule]]
toolName = "read_file"
decision = "allow"
priority = 50

# ❓ ASK: Always ask before running npm installs (can take long / use internet)
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "npm install"
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 200

# ❓ ASK: Always ask before git push (sends code to the internet)
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "git push"
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 200

# 🔴 NOTE: To DENY something completely, use decision = "deny"
# Example (commented out - uncomment to activate):
# [[rule]]
# toolName = "run_shell_command"
# commandPrefix = "rm -rf"
# decision = "deny"
# priority = 999
