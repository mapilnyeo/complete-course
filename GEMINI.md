# Basecamp Coffee - Project Context (GEMINI.md)

## 📋 Role
I am the **new manager** at Basecamp Coffee, responsible for operations, team management, and customer experience.

## ☕️ Company Overview
- **Brand Identity:** Warm, authentic, community-focused (the local shop that knows your name).
- **Scale:** 45 locations across the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, Portland, Boise).
- **Brand Voice:** Friendly, genuine, knowledgeable, playful (avoid corporate jargon and all-caps).

## 🚨 Urgent Problem: Basecamp Rewards
- **Status:** The loyalty program is failing and at risk of termination in **3 months**.
- **The Core Issue:** It's "fine but forgettable." Only 17% of members are active.
- **Goal:** Transform the program from a generic points-only system into something with **personality and identity**.

## 💡 Key Strategy & Findings
- **Discovery Opportunity:** Customers want help finding their "signature drink."
- **Seed Idea:** The **"Coffee Personality Quiz"** (found in previous manager Marcus's notes). 
- **Competition:** Starbucks (gamification), Dutch Bros (relationship), Evergreen (identity). Basecamp needs to "out-personality" them.

## 📂 File Structure Guide
- `company-context/`: Brand guidelines, program structure, and initial scenario.
- `organized/`: Synthesized research, action items, and leadership updates.
- `inherited-chaos/`: Raw messy notes, 4 months of customer feedback, competitor research.
- `templates/`: Official reporting formats.
- `attachments/`: Visual assets like the generic loyalty flyer.

## 🛠️ Preferred Workflow
- **Analysis:** Think step-by-step before major conclusions.
- **Action:** Create or update files in the `organized/` folder for clarity.
- **Tone:** Maintain the warm Basecamp Brand Voice in all customer-facing drafts.
